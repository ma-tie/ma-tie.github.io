  abstract={A network emulation system supporting a flexible and efficient dynamic experiment emulates a network based on container, veth-pair, traffic control (TC), and other technologies and sets a network state management model based on a key-value pair, thereby constructing a network emulation system supporting a flexible and efficient dynamic experiment. The system flexibly realizes the dynamic performance of a plurality of dimensions, namely, dynamic node start/stop, dynamic node attribute configuration, dynamic link start/stop, and dynamic link attribute configuration. Based on the network state management model, the network emulation system provides a concise and unified dynamic application programming interface (API) for an upper layer. Researchers can call the API in their network innovation programs at any time after an emulation network is deployed to achieve efficient, batch-processing, and programmable dynamic management. The network emulation system greatly facilitates the experimental work of the researchers in a dynamic scenario of the network.},

  abstract={The explosive growth of global distributed services has led to a massive increase in bulk multicast data transfers over the inter-datacenter Wide-Area Network. While many solutions have been proposed to improve the performance of inter-DC bulk data transfers, they are insufficient to optimize multicast transfers because they fail to explore the characteristics of multicast transfers and network topology. This paper presents FlexCast, a flexible and efficient solution to optimize the completion times for multicast transfers. FlexCast takes advantage of topological characteristics to divide network sites into groups, partition receivers into subsets, and construct load-adaptive Steiner trees for receiver partitions to reduce completion time. It also employs a flexible multicast model for parallel transmission. For better performance FlexCast uses multiple scheduling policies to handle offline request submission, and for greater efficiency it adopts a combination of small-scale optimization and fast heuristic to address online request submission quickly. Simulations on real-world topologies show that FlexCast improves the completion time for multicast receivers by up to 80% compared to prior solutions.},

  abstract={Measuring traffic metrics is indispensable in virtual networks as it is the basis for a wide range of applications, such as network diagnostics and performance evaluation of the network algorithms. However, existing measurement schemes fail to have all these excellent characteristics simultaneously: 1) fine-grained, i.e. to obtain per packet level information. 2) lightweight, namely low CPU and bandwidth overhead. 3) network-wide, which means obtaining metrics of the whole network, e.g. per packet path. 4) easy-to-deploy, which refers to deployment without additional modification of Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs). We design vNetRadar, a virtual network measurement system, which has these excellent characteristics simultaneously. Specifically, vNetRadar 1) identifies each packet without increasing the size of each packet, to obtain network-wide metrics without MTU modification, 2) allocates each packet an area in memory, called backpack, and carries metadata in it to largely reduce bandwidth overhead. vNetRadar is implemented based on the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) and is mainly in kernel space, avoiding the CPU overhead of copying packets to user space when performing the fine-grained measurement. Evaluation results show that the easy-to-deploy vNetRadar can get fine-grained network-wide metrics with low CPU and bandwidth overhead.},

  abstract={As the key infrastructure for emerging 5G and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, micro data centers would be widely deployed at network edges to provide high-bandwidth low-latency cloud service. In these systems, applications would deliver large-size data objects among servers for various purposes like service deployment, application scale-up, and data duplication on demand. Accordingly, reducing delivery time is crucial for the optimization of service delay and system utilization. To accelerate the delivery, this article proposes a multisource-aware adaptive data transmission solution, Parallel Push (PPUSH), by leveraging the fact that data objects in the cloud are generally replicated among servers by design. At the high level, PPUSH achieves efficient delivery of multisource data by launching multiple push flows in parallel; and at the low level, it decouples transfers from different sources by encoding data objects with rateless RaptorQ code, and further employing novel congestion controls to prioritize the bandwidth allocation of concurrent tasks respecting their remaining sizes. Fluid model analysis along with Mininet-based test and packet-level simulation shows that, unlike DCTCP and other proposals, push is robust to packet loss and achieves provable prioritized bandwidth allocation. Extensive simulation results imply that, with above advantages, PPUSH could achieve very efficient data delivery by making use of all available data sources: for instance, compared with the straightforward design of equal-size task split and fair bandwidth allocation, its adaptive task assignment and prioritized traffic scheduling reduce the average task completion time in a tested scenario by 1.495× and 1.329×, respectively, demonstrating a total improvement of 1.586×, when enabled at the same time.},
